    String literals are string slices.
    We have declared a string slice initialized with a string literal.
    String literals have a static lifetime, which means the string is guaranteed to be valid for the duration of the entire program.
    It is usually seen in its borrowed form, &str.
    A &str is made up of two components: a pointer to some bytes, and a length.
