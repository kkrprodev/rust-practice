/** Strings are implemented as a collection of bytes.
Rust has only one string type in the core language,
which is the string slice *str* that is usually seen in its borrowed form *&str*.
The *String* type, which is provided by Rustâ€™s standard library rather than coded into the core language,
is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type.
Both String and string slice are UTF-8 encoded.

Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.
A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.
A string slice is a reference to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored elsewhere or
A string slice is a reference to part of a String.

We create slices using a range within brackets by specifying [starting_index..ending_index],
where starting_index is the first position in the slice and ending_index is one more than the last position in the slice.
Internally, the slice data structure stores the starting position and the length of the slice,
which corresponds to ending_index minus starting_index.

String literals stores inside the binary. string literals are immutable; &str is an immutable reference.
